# The simexvsmecor Package
This package for R entails the code to execute a simulation study
and the code used to analyse the output of the simulation study, 
accompanying the manuscript "Random measurement error correction in an exposure 
by means of simulation-extrapolation and regression calibration". The aim of the
simulation study is the comparison between the simex and mecor package for 
measurement error correction.

# Installation
The package can be installed via
```r
devtools::install_github("LindaNab/simexvsmecor", ref = "main")
```

# Quick demo
```r
library(simexvsmecor)
# view input data
data(input)
# run scenenario no. 1 of the simulation study with 100 replicates
run_sim(nrep = 100, scen_no = 1)
```
