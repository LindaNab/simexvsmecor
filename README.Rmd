# The simexvsmecor Package
This package for R entails the simulation code to execute the simulation study
and the analysis code used to produce the results from the simulation study, 
accompanying the manuscript "Random measurement error correction in an exposure 
by means of simulation-extrapolation and regression calibration". The simulation 
study is set up to compare the simex and mecor package for measurement error 
correction.

# Installation
The package can be installed via
```r
devtools::install_github("LindaNab/simexvsmecor", ref = "main")
```

# Quick demo
```r
library(simexvsmecor)
# view input data
data(input)
# run scenenario no. 1 of the simulation study with 100 replicates
run_sim(nrep = 100, scen_no = 1)
```
